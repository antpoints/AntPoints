### AntPoints referred to as ANT
ANT is not a currency, but a global point system.

The purpose of ANT is to make the points more valuable and popular for more people to use, so it has the following characteristics:

1. ANT issued 100 billion in the first year, and all ANT will be pledged on the trading platform at a very low price, ensuring that anyone can afford it.
2. Automatic inflation, each transaction in the future will reward the transaction initiator with a new ANT.

The experimental results show that the [Conflux network](https://confluxnetwork.org/) will run at a fixed rate of generating two blocks per second. The number of blocks per day is about 60×60×24×2=172,800. If there is an ANT transaction in each block on average , Then there will be 172,800×365=62,208,000 new ANTs generated in a year, so that the annual inflation will be around 0.06%.

The smaller the transaction volume, the fewer new ANTs will be generated. As the transaction volume increases, the new ANTs generated will also increase. This reflects a viable market supply and demand relationship, which can finally stabilize the price of ANT so that it can become a popular product rather than a rare species.
